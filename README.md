The first iteration is a basic RAG application that answers questions based on the PDF document you upload.



I wholly believe that learning occurs from experimentation and questioning, logically, this is what leads you down those spirals of discovering so many new things and building new interests. I want to make this into a platform that allows you to learn from research papers, no matter your previous knowledge level. A platform that can dynamically generate content to learn from such as simulations or Desmos-style graphs where you can tweak values and play around with the concepts.

The draft on the right is what I envision to be the goal for now, where if I uploaded a paper about NLPs and I had no prior knowledge about what NLPs are, it would give me a simulation of how NLPs work with log probabilities, and I can just mess around with it.


Thatâ€™s the end goal for this project
